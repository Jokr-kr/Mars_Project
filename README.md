- **1.** First thing i encountered whas how to make a reasonable and professional looking README file
- (solution)got help from readme.so and some minor inputs from Chat gpt to get the syntax right
- **2.** learning about node,react,axios,express,MySQL and how to use api's all in a short period of time,
  (used Linkedin Learning, some youtube, friends and some questions was sent to chat gpt to get a deeper understanding about certain concepts
  this whole learning period lasted two weeks before i could start writing code in this project)
- **3.** ran an npm update latest, got a mesage about vulnerabilities, spent some time figuring out what that meant and how to deal with it.
  (learned that not all issues with vulnerabilities are important to solve)
